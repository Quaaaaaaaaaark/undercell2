LYSONDER: Another correct question. We are quickly approaching the end of our little game. 
LYSONDER: Allow me to confide something in you. The truth is... the LYSOSOMES have been holding back.
LYSONDER: It's no fun if it all ends too quickly, you see?
LYSONDER: But you've proven resilient so far...
LYSONDER: So now, enjoy this opportunity to do what many others never came close to.
LYSONDER: Prepare to face the full might of the LYSOSOMES! Don't hold back - WE CERTAINLY WILL NOT!
STOP
