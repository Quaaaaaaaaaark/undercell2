ACTIN DIESEL: No good, kid. You wanna prove your stuff? You're gonna have to drive.
Press SPACEBAR to 'flap' upwards. Gravity will drag you downwards. Don't crash!
ACTIN DIESEL: Almost had it? You never had it - you never had a clue. Granny guessing, not double checking like you should.
ACTIN DIESEL: A real driver knows exactly what's in their cell.
ACTIN DIESEL: That won't get you across the finish line. This isn't a junkyard, it's a microfilament.

ACTIN DIESEL: Keep your monomers. Your respect is good enough for me.
STOP
