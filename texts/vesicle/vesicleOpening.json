You are surrounded by four eager VESICLE vendors.
VESICLIVE: Hello there! What can I do for ya?
VESICLEO: Over here, over here! No vesicle is faster!
VESICLINT: Don't listen to them - my vesicle services are the best in the cell!
VESICLARA: Hey, just between you and me, his vesicle is old and breaking down. MY vesicle came out of the membrane just yesterday!
VESICLIVE: What was that?
VESICLEO: You aren't looking for a ride?
VESICLINT: You just want to learn about VESICLES?
VESICLARA: Well, that's a shame!
VESICLIVE: I'd be happy to help you out! I doubt any of these other VESICLE vendors would give you any passing thought-
VESICLEO: Of course! Of course! Just step over here and I'll teach you all about-
VESICLINT: Nobody knows more about the VESICLES than me! Come talk to me and I'm sure you'll see-
VESICLARA: Ignore them! I'd love to help you out, I've got better rates than any of-
VESICLIVE: EVERYBODY QUIET! This isn't going anywhere.
VESICLEO: It occurs to me that we may need to work together on this.
VESICLINT: Perhaps you'd learn more from the four of us together than any of us separately.
VESICLARA: And perhaps it would be good to keep us away from each other's throats for a few moments.
VESICLINT: Let's start by figuring out what you already know. Can you tell me what the purpose of our vesicles is?
