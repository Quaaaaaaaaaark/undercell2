VESICLIVE: NAILED IT!
VESICLEO: That's all four correct!
VESICLINT: There's nothing more that any of us can teach you about the VESICLES.
VESICLARA: Now, might I interest you in purchasing a VESICLE from me? It'll help you navigate the cell so much quicker!
VESICLIVE: Don't listen to her! My VESICLES are the finest around! You'll be travelling in style!
VESICLEO: Last decade's style, maybe! My VESICLES are modern, top-of-the-line vehicles! Just wait until you see the membrane on mine...
VESICLINT: That's an outright lie! Her vesicles can barely even connect to the cell membrane anymore! Mine, however, work at peak performance at all times.
VESICLARA: Maybe, but that doesn't matter if it takes ages to get there! My VESICLES are faster than anyone else's...
You sneak away as the four of them argue. It's probably best to just use your own VESICLE.
