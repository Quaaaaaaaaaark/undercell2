VESICLIVE: You got it wrong? Oh, that's all right! How about a quick VESICLE ride to cheer you up?
VESICLARA: Watch out! You'll have to use the LEFT and RIGHT keys to switch lanes and avoid crashing into any obstacles!
VESICLINT: Don't worry that you got it wrong! Just blame it on CLEO, she won't mind!
VESICLEO: Incorrect? Ehhh, just say it's CLINT'S fault. That always works for me.
VESICLIVE: Pssst. Here's a quick secret. Whenever I get a question wrong... I just say it's CLARA'S fault.
VESICLARA: I got your back! I'll just tell everyone CLIVE made you mess up.
STOP
