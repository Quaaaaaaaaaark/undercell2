MEMBRANDALF: Incorrect? You may wish it hadn't happened, but that is not for you to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
MEMBRANDALF: But never mind that! Would you give me some assistance with my work? Use the ARROW KEYS to move side to side, and don't let any molecules past!
MEMBRANDALF: Do not fear. Even darkness will pass. A new day will come. And when the correct answer shines, it will shine out the clearer.
MEMBRANDALF: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Incorrectness is just another path, one that we all must take eventually.
MEMBRANDALF: I urge you to do better. If this were a test... YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
MEMBRANDALF: There is no time. The molecules approach! Fly, you fool!
STOP
