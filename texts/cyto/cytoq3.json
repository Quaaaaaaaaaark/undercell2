CYBIL: This reminds me of that time I got quizzed by those lysosome enzymes...
CYBIL: They thought I... and that... and maybe... ah, who cares about that old story! Let's get on to the interesting bit, shall we?
CYBIL: So this CYTOPLASM is split into two main subsections, the ectoplasm and the endoplasm. 
CYBIL: Can you tell me the difference between the ECTOPLASM and the ENDOPLASM?
