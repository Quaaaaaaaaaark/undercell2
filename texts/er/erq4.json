ROUGH EDDY: Well, only one thing left to do.
SMOOTH EDDY: See? We've basically finished. 'S no big deal.
ROUGH EDDY: That's true. But what happens when the next protein comes here, wanting to learn about the ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM?
ROUGH EDDY: And the next?
ROUGH EDDY: And the next?
ROUGH EDDY: AND THE NEXT?
SMOOTH EDDY: We'll get through it, like we always do.
SMOOTH EDDY: We're not the ones dodging proteins in a little box, after all.
ROUGH EDDY: All right, here's your last question.
ROUGH EDDY: Here's something interesting. You won't find it in an AMOEBA PROTEUS like this one, but some cells have SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM.
ROUGH EDDY: It's a type of ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM, but with a different function. Can you tell me what it is?
