VACULIAN: What is this? It seems some molecules are trying to escape the CENTRAL VACUOLE. We can return to your questions later.
VACULIAN: Use the ARROW KEYS to select the section of the CENTRAL VACUOLE that the molecules are about to hit. That should keep them inside.
VACULIAN: Ah, incorrect. You really should've hydrated more today.
You expect VACULIAN to tell you something about drinking water, but they're too busy hydrating themself.
VACULIAN: Disappointing, but no surprise. Your dehydration must be messing with your head.
VACULIAN: H Y D R A T E
