PERRY: Good. You know the basics of our PEROXISOME, at least.
PERRY: There is more I would ask you, but if you want me to put up with your questioning, you'll need to do something for me.
PERRY: The fatty acids are quickly approaching. You will need to use the ARROW KEYS to move around, and then SPACEBAR or ENTER to fire an oxidation beam.
PERRY: What is an oxidation beam, you ask? It's not biologically accurate, so don't worry too hard about it.
PERRY: The important thing is that you mustn't let any fatty acids escape unoxidized!
