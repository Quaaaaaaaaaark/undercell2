PERRY: Hold your answer a moment. We have more pressing matters to deal with. Fatty acids are approaching. Will you assist us?
PERRY: Use the ARROW KEYS to move around, and press SPACEBAR or ENTER to shoot an 'oxidation beam'. Don't let any fatty acids pass by unoxidized!
PERRY: I fear that question was correct. Prove yourself by oxidizing these fatty acids, and I'll consider giving you another chance.
PERRY: Incorrect...  you have much to learn about the PEROXISOME. Now, to oxidize the fatty acids!
PERRY: I'm afraid there is no time to examine that answer further. Quickly, we much oxidize this next group!
